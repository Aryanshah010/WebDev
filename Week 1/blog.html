            I began my journey into web development during my 5th semester of Computer Science.
            At first, HTML and CSS felt simple, but soon I realized the power of JavaScript.
            It's exciting to build projects that people can interact with, and I
            aim to become a full-stack developer.
            In this blog, I'll document my progress and share what I learn.

            My very first project was creating a resume using only HTML.
            It included sections like Education, Skills, and Hobbies.
            Even though it was plain, it gave me confidence.
            Next, I will style it using CSS and eventually make it look
            professional.
